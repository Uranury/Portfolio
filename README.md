# My Go Backend Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm currently a **beginner** developer, focused on becoming a **backend Go developer**. This repository showcases projects and exercises I've been working on as I progress in my Go programming journey, including both backend development and CLI tools.

## About Me

I'm passionate about mastering Go for backend development. My learning journey includes:

- Building REST APIs
- Working with databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Developing CLI applications using Cobra
- Structuring Go projects
- Error handling, testing, and optimization
- Exploring key concepts of Go

## Projects

Here are the key areas of focus in my portfolio:

### 1. **Backend Development**
In this section, you'll find projects related to backend development, such as REST APIs that integrate with databases.

- **Technologies:** Go, Gorilla Mux, GORM, SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Focus Areas:** Database operations (CRUD), routing, middleware, and deployment.

### 2. **CLI Tools (Cobra)**
This section contains command-line interfaces (CLI) that I've built using the Cobra library. These tools allow me to gain hands-on experience with building powerful and flexible command-line applications.

- **Technologies:** Go, Cobra
- **Focus Areas:** Handling commands, flags, arguments, and building reusable CLI applications.
  
  Example:
  - **CLI Tool Name:** `task-cli`
    - **Description:** A task management CLI application.
    - **Usage:** 
      ```bash
      task-cli add "New task"
      task-cli list
      ```

## Goals

- Deepen my knowledge of Go for backend development and trying to find my niche.
- Create real-world applications with a focus on scalability and efficiency.
- Build reliable, scalable, and maintainable backend systems, CLI utilities and more.

## How to Run

To run any of the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-directory
   ```
3. Run the Go application:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

For CLI tools:
1. Build the CLI tool:
   ```bash
   go build -o your-cli-tool
   ```
2. Run the CLI commands:
   ```bash
   ./your-cli-tool command args
   ```
